    "> Only recently have I begun to realize that the problem is not merely one of technical mastery or the competent application of the rules ... but that there is actually something else which is guiding these rules. It actually involves a different level of mastery. It's quite a different process to do it right; and every single act that you do can be done in that sense well or badly. But even assuming that you have got the technical part clear, the creation of this quality is a much more complicated process of the most utterly absorbing and fascinating dimensions. It is in fact a major creative or artistic act -- every single little thing you do -- ...\n",

    "In this chapter we look at the key notion of type and its generalization mode. We show that every FriCAS object has a type that determines what you can do with the object. In particular, we explain how to use types to call specific functions from particular parts of the library and how types and modes can be used to create new objects from old. We also look at Record and Union types and the special type Any. Finally, we give you an idea of how FriCAS manipulates types and modes internally to resolve ambiguities. "

    "## 2.1 The Basic Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "The FriCAS world deals with many kinds of objects. There are mathematical objects such as numbers and polynomials, data structure objects such as lists and arrays, and graphics objects such as points and graphic images. Functions are objects too.\n",
    "\n",
    "FriCAS organizes objects using the notion of domain of computation, or simply _domain_. Each domain denotes a class of objects. The class of objects it denotes is usually given by the name of the domain: `Integer` for the integers, `Float` for floating-point numbers, and so on. The convention is that the first letter of a domain name is capitalized. Similarly, the domain `Polynomial(Integer)` denotes _polynomials with integer coefficients_. Also, `Matrix(Float)` denotes matrices with floating-point entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every basic FriCAS object belongs to a unique domain. The integer `3` belongs to the domain `Integer` and the polynomial $x+3$ belongs to the domain `Polynomial(Integer)`. The domain of an object is also called its **_type_**. Thus we speak of the _type_ `Integer` and the _type_ `Polynomial(Integer)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "After an FriCAS computation, the type is displayed toward the right-hand side of the page (or screen). "

To create the domain of polynomials over the integers, FriCAS applies the function `Polynomial` to the domain `Integer`. A function like `Polynomial` is called a domain constructor or, more simply, a constructor. A domain constructor is a function that creates a domain. An argument to a domain constructor can be another domain or, in general, an arbitrary kind of object.

Domain constructor `List` is able to build lists of elements from domain `D` for arbitrary `D` simply by requiring that `D` belong to category `Type`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you may ask, what exactly is a category? Like domains, categories can be defined in the FriCAS language. A category is defined by three components:\n",
    "\n",
    "*    a name (for example, `Ring`), used to refer to the class of domains that the category represents;\n",
    "*    a set of operations, used to refer to the operations that the domains of this class support (for example, `+`, `-`, and `*` for rings); and\n",
    "*    an optional list of other categories that this category extends.\n",
    "\n",
    "This last component is a new idea. And it is key to the design of FriCAS! Because categories can extend one another, they form hierarchies. Detailed charts showing the category hierarchies in FriCAS are displayed in [Appendix](). There you see that all categories are extensions of `Type` and that `Field` is an extension of `Ring`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The operations supported by the domains of a category are called the _exports_ of that category because these are the operations made available for system-wide use. The exports of a domain of a given category are not only the ones explicitly mentioned by the category. Since a category extends other categories, the operations of these other categories - and all categories these other categories extend - are also exported by the domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, polynomial domains belong to `PolynomialCategory`. This category explicitly mentions some twenty-nine operations on polynomials, but it extends eleven other categories (including `Ring`). As a result, the current system has over one hundred operations on polynomials.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a domain belongs to a category that extends, say, `Ring`, it is convenient to say that the domain exports `Ring`. The name of the category thus provides a convenient shorthand for the list of operations exported by the category. Rather than listing operations such as `+` and `*` of `Ring` each time they are needed, the definition of a type simply asserts that it exports category `Ring`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The category name, however, is more than a shorthand. The name `Ring`, in fact, implies that the operations exported by rings are required to satisfy a set of axioms associated with the name `Ring`. This subtle but _important_ feature distinguishes FriCAS from other abstract datatype designs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is it not correct to assume that some type is a ring if it exports all of the operations of `Ring`? Here is why. Some languages such as `APL` denote the Boolean constants `true` and `false` by the integers `1` and `0` respectively, then use `+` and `*` to denote the logical operators `or` and `and`. But with these definitions `Boolean` is not a ring since the additive inverse axiom is violated. That is, there is no inverse element a such that $1+a=0$, or, in the usual terms: `true` or `a = false`. This alternative definition of `Boolean` can be easily and correctly implemented in FriCAS, since `Boolean` simply does not assert that it is of category `Ring`. This prevents the system from building meaningless domains such as `Polynomial(Boolean)` and then wrongfully applying algorithms that presume that the ring axioms hold.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enough on categories. To learn more about them, see Chapter [ugCategories]() . We now return to our discussion of domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "Domains export a set of operations to make them available for system-wide use. `Integer`, for example, exports the operations `+` and `=` given by the signatures `+: (Integer,Integer)->Integer` and `=: (Integer,Integer)->Boolean`, respectively. Each of these operations takes two `Integer` arguments. The `+` operation also returns an `Integer` but `=` returns a `Boolean`: `true` or `false`. The operations exported by a domain usually manipulate objects of the domain - but not always.\n",
    "\n",
    "The operations of a domain may actually take as arguments, and return as values, objects from any domain. For example, `Fraction (Integer)` exports the operations `/:(Integer,Integer) -> Fraction(Integer)` and `characteristic : -> NonNegativeInteger`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose all operations of a domain take as arguments and return as values, only objects from other domains. This _kind_ of domain is what FriCAS calls a **_package_**.\n",
    "\n",
    "A _package_ does not designate a class of objects at all. Rather, a package is just a collection of operations. Actually the bulk of the FriCAS library of algorithms consists of packages. The facilities for factorization; integration; solution of linear, polynomial, and differential equations; computation of limits; and so on, are all defined in packages. Domains needed by algorithms can be passed to a package as arguments or used by name if they are not variable. Packages are useful for defining operations that convert objects of one type to another, particularly when these types have different parameterizations. As an example, the package `PolynomialFunction2(R,S)` defines operations that convert polynomials over a domain `R` to polynomials over `S`. To convert an object from `Polynomial(Integer)` to `Polynomial(Float)`, FriCAS builds the package `PolynomialFunctions2(Integer,Float)` in order to create the required conversion function. (This happens behind the scenes for you: see [ugTypesConvert]() for details on how to convert objects.)\n",
    "\n",
    "FriCAS categories, domains and packages and all their contained functions are written in the FriCAS programming language and have been compiled into machine code. This is what comprises the FriCAS _library_. We will show you how to use these domains and their functions and how to write your own functions. "
