fricas_input/nb/input2ipynb
===========================

Input files from  fricas/src/input (253).

These files have been converted to notebooks (.ipynb) by the 
function 'inputToNotebook' in spad/io/io.spad. This serves to test 
the iSPAD kernel in the first place.

In order to convert them again run "make.sh > make.log" or perform the 
steps manually as followd:

Go to 'input' and do:
  $ fricas -nosman
  > )read inputToNotebook

The output files '.ipynb' are written to the same folder. Move them
to the folder "ipynb" for further processing. 


----------------------------------
Automated execution and conversion
----------------------------------

You need 'nbconvert':

$ pip search nbconvert  
jupyter_nbconvert         - Converting Jupyter Notebooks
tpllib                    - A library with jupyter nbconvert templates
nbconvert                 - Converting Jupyter Notebooks
  INSTALLED: 4.1.0 (latest)

!! Be sure to have version >= 4.1.0. Older versions do not work !!

See: https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert/blob/master/docs/source/usage.rst

Step 1
------
cd to 'ipynb':

$ for a in *.ipynb; do jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --allow-errors /
   --execute $a ; done 


This will open the notebook, execute it, capture new output, and save the
result in :file:`mynotebook.nbconvert.ipynb`. By default, nbconvert will 
abort conversion if any exceptions occur during execution of a cell. If you
specify --allow-errors (in addition to the --execute flag) then conversion
will continue and the output from any exception will be included in the 
cell output.


Step 2
------
cd to 'nbconvert.ipynb'

$for a in *.nbconvert.ipynb; do jupyter nbconvert --to html $a ; done            

The command above will do a full static HTML render of the notebook. 
This looks very similar to the interactive view.


----------
Statistics
----------

ls -l *.input | wc -l           => 253
ls -l *.ipynb | wc -l           => 253
ls -l *.nbconvert.ipynb | wc -l => 233

Sice GitHub can render Jupyter notebooks you can view them by simply
clicking on them in the repository folder. The 'html' files of the
executed notebooks are in 'nbconvert.html'.
