-- in each case, the argument to 'atan' has a pole and the left-hand
-- and right-hand limits differ

limit(atan(1/sin(x)),x = 0)

limit(atan(sqrt(1 - x^2)/x),x = 0)

limit(atan(-sin(x)/(cos(x) + a)),x = acos(-a))

limit(atan(sin(x)/(cos(x) + a)),x = acos(-a))

-- we'll get these next two if sqrt(1 - a^2) is considered to be
-- positive by SIGNEF
