--- Column Descriptions
--- -------------------
--- Isotope: Atomic number, Symbol, and Mass number 
---
--- Relative Atomic Mass (of the isotope):  Ar(X), where X is an isotope
--- [formerly called atomic weight (see Standard Atomic Weight)]
--- These values are scaled to Ar(12C) = 12, where 12C is a neutral atom in 
--- its nuclear and electronic ground state. Thus, the relative atomic mass 
--- of entity X is given by: Ar(X) = m(X) / [m(12C) / 12] . If # is present, 
--- the value and error were derived not from purely experimental data, but 
--- at least partly from systematic trends. The 1995 Update To The Atomic 
--- Mass Evaluation does not extend beyond an atomic mass of 273. 
---
--- Representative Isotopic Composition (%):  Mole fraction of the various 
--- isotopes
---
--- In the opinion of the Subcommittee for Isotopic Abundance Measurements 
--- (SIAM), these values represent the isotopic composition of the chemicals 
--- and/or materials most commonly encountered in the laboratory. They may not, 
--- therefore, correspond to the most abundant natural material.
--- The uncertainties listed in parenthesis cover the range of probable 
--- variations of the materials as well as experimental errors. These values 
--- are consistent with the values to be published in Atomic Weights of the 
--- Elements 1997.
---
--- Standard Atomic Weight (common usage):  Ar(X), where X is an element
--- [more appropriately called relative atomic mass of the element]
---
--- The relative atomic mass of an element is derived by averaging the 
--- relative atomic masses of the isotopes of that element. These values 
--- are scaled to Ar(12C) = 12, where 12C is a neutral atom in its nuclear
--- and electronic ground state. These values are dependent on the origin
--- and treatment of the material. The uncertainties are listed in parenthesis.
--- Brackets [ ] indicate the mass number of the most stable isotope.
---
---
--- Notes for Representative Isotopic Composition and Standard Atomic Weight
---
--- a   Air reference material used for the best measurement. 	 
--- b 	Commercially available Li materials have atomic weights that range 
---     between 6.939 and 6.996; if a more accurate value is required, it must
---     be determined for the specific material.
---     Note: The range given in Atomic Weights of the Elements 1995 
---     was 6.94 to 6.99.
--- c 	The range of 2H in tank hydrogen is 0.0032 - 0.0184 atom %.
--- d 	Materials depleted in 6Li and 235U are commercial sources of laboratory
---     shelf reagents. In the case of Li such samples are known to have 6Li
---     abundances in the range 2.007 - 7.672 atom %, with natural materials
---     at the higher end of this range.
--- e 	The Commission on Atomic Weights and Isotopic Abundances recommends 
---     that the value of 272 be employed for 14N/15N of N2 in air for the 
---     calculation of atom % 15N from measured delta15N values.
--- f 	Evaluated isotopic composition is for most but not all commercial 
---     samples. Some isotopes are altered because of the contribution of a 
---     daughter product from the radioactive decay of another element. 
---     These isotopes are: 40Ca, 87Sr, 138Ce, 143Nd, 176Hf, 187Os, 206Pb, 
---     207Pb, 208Pb, and 235U. Because the abundances must add up to 100 
---     percent the abundances of all isotopes of an element are affected.
--- g 	Geological specimens are known in which the element has an isotopic 
---     composition outside the limits for normal material. The difference 
---     between the atomic weight of the element in such specimens and that 
---     given in the table may exceed the stated uncertainty.
--- h 	An electron multiplier was used for these measurements and the measured
---     abundances were adjusted using a square root of the masses.
--- m 	Modified isotopic compositions may be found in commercially available
---     material because it has been subjected to an undisclosed or inadvertent
---     isotopic fractionation. Substantial deviations in the atomic weight 
---     and isotopic composition of the element from that given in the table 
---     can occur.
--- r 	Range in isotopic composition of normal terrestrial material limits 
---     the precision of isotopic composition and atomic weight. The tabulated 
---     values should be applicable to any normal material.
--- w 	Fresh water reference material used for the best measurement.
---
--- Note: Elements 113 and 115 were added by SciOS (from public sources)
