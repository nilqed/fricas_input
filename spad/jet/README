Pseudo Differential Operators and Integrable Systems in AXIOM
Reference: Computer Physics Communications, 79 (1994) 329-340
Description: This paper describes the implementation of a few domains for 
the algebra of pseudo differential operators and its application in the 
theory of integrable systems, especially for the construction of families 
of Lax pairs. This is demonstrated with some classical examples like the 
KdV hierarchy. Probably the package is by now obsolete, as I have not 
taken the trouble to update it to later versions of AXIOM.

Applying AXIOM to Partial Differential Equations
Reference: Internal Report 95-17. Fakultät für Informatik, Universität 
Karlsruhe, 1995 
Description: This technical report is basically made up of a chapter of 
my Ph.D. thesis. It describes the usage and the implementation of an 
AXIOM environment for the formal theory of differential equations (which 
is now obsolete, as we have switched to MuPAD - see [76] ). It outlines 
the implemented hierarchy of categories and domains for differential 
equations. Two applications are studied: the implementation of a Lie 
symmetry package and of a completion package (following the 
Cartan-Kuranishi algorithm). A number of examples are given.
