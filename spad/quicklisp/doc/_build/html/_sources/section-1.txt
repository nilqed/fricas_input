**Quicklisp** is a library manager for *Common Lisp*. It works with your 
existing Common Lisp implementation to download, install, and load any of 
over 1,200 libraries with a few simple commands.

Quicklisp is easy to install and works with ABCL, Allegro CL, Clasp, 
Clozure CL, CLISP, CMUCL, ECL, LispWorks, MKCL, SBCL, and Scieneer CL, 
on Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows.  

:Note:
If you have one of the Common Lisp flavours installed then it is recommended 
to follow the instructions on the Quicklisp homepage. Otherwise Quicklisp 
may be installed using **FriCAS**, as described in the following section.

If Quicklisp is already installed then you may skip the following section and
jump to x.

2. Installing with FriCAS
-------------------------
Since FriCAS is based on Common Lisp we can install Quicklisp as follows:

* Download https://beta.quicklisp.org/quicklisp.lisp
* Start FriCAS
* ``)lisp (load "quicklisp.lisp")``
* ``)lisp (quicklisp-quickstart:install)``
